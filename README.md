Problem Statement:
Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain, headquartered in Mumbai, India and was founded by Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapoor in 2004. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether predictive models can do justice to such situations.
